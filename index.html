                <div class="bio-col">
                    <p>Vincent van Gogh was a painter from the Netherlands. He was born in 1853 in Zundert. At first, he worked in an art shop and tried being a preacher. Then, he chose to become a painter and mostly taught himself.</p><br>
                    <p>At first, he painted farmers and workers, like in The Potato Eaters. After moving to Paris in 1886, he met other artists and started using brighter colors. His most active time was in Arles, where he made Sunflowers and The Bedroom. He later had mental health issues and stayed in a hospital, where he painted The Starry Night. He died in 1890.</p><br>

                <div class="bio-col">
                    <p>Van Gogh was deeply interested in nature, people, and spirituality, believing that art should express emotion and moral depth. He used color symbolically, with yellow often representing warmth and divinity. Though largely unrecognized during his life, his works and letters to his brother Theo have since become invaluable, making him one of the most influential figures in modern art history.</p><br>

                <p class="profesi-right">Vincent van Gogh was a famous painter whose artworks still inspire people today. Some of his paintings are very well-known because of their strong feelings, special style, and memorable look.</p>

                    <div class="iconic-text">
                        <p>Vincent van Gogh created many iconic paintings, and four of the most famous are The Starry Night (1889), Sunflowers (1888), Irises (1889), and The Night Café (1888). The Starry Night shows a swirling night sky full of stars and a bright moon, painted while Van Gogh was in a mental hospital. Sunflowers is a bright and warm painting of yellow flowers in a vase, made to welcome his friend Paul Gauguin.</p><br>
                        <p>Irises was painted during his stay in the hospital and shows peaceful blue flowers with strong contrast. The Night Café uses bold red and green colors to express a feeling of loneliness and discomfort in a small café. These works show Van Gogh’s emotions, his love of nature, and his unique artistic style.</p>
